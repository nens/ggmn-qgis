GGMN qgis plugin
================

Goal: integrate the GGMN data from Lizard so that you can do additional
analysis in qgis: mainly interpolation. The interpolation results (rasters)
can be uploaded to Lizard. Also you should be able to add local data points
and upload them back to Lizard.

The plugin will *not* provide a complete setup and walk-through. You should
set up a base map and the interpolation plugin yourself, for instance.
